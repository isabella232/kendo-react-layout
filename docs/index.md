# Layout Package Overview

Layout controls create a perceptive and intuitive layout of web projects to provide for an easier navigation. Currently, the Layout package includes the Kendo UI Tabstrip and PanelBar components for React.

The Tabstrip displays a collection of tabs with associated content, which allow the user to open many pages inside a single window. Each tab represents a separate location and by selecting a particular tab, the user navigates between the tab pages.

The PanelBar for React is a stateless component that displays hierarchical data as a multi-level, expandable component. To store its state and configuration options, use a high-order component.
