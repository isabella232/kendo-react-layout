# Layout Package Overview (draft)

Layout controls create a perceptive and intuitive layout of web projects to provide for an easier navigation. Currently, the Layout package includes the Kendo UI TabStrip component for React.

The Kendo UI TabStrip displays a collection of tabs with associated content, which allow the user to open many pages inside a single window. Each tab represents a separate location and by selecting a particular tab, the user navigates between the tab pages.

The Kendo UI PanelBar displays hierarchical data as multi-level, expandable content. It is designed as a stateless component&mdash;to store its state and configuration options, wrap it up in a high-order component.
